    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe I just kind of fooled around with and made up. When I first tasted it I was proud! I felt like I was eating a meal from a gourmet Italian restaurant!</p>
        
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white wine</li>
        <li>1 pound linguine pasta</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>Â½ teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) package crumbled feta cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> In a medium skillet over medium heat, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil. Cook shrimp, garlic and white wine for 5 minutes, or until shrimp is pink. Remove shrimp with slotted spoon and set aside.</li>
        <li>   Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.</li>
        <li>   While pasta is cooking, cook tomatoes with remaining 1 tablespoon oil, oregano and basil over medium heat in wine mixture until tender, 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Toss hot pasta with shrimp, tomato sauce and feta. Feta will melt slightly. Serve.</li>

    </ol>
